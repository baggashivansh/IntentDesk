# IntentDesk

**Live Demo:** [https://intent-desk.vercel.app](https://intent-desk.vercel.app)

IntentDesk is an intent driven generative UI workspace where users describe what they want in plain English and the interface adapts dynamically to that intent.

Built for **The UI Strikes Back Hackathon** using the **Tambo Generative UI SDK**.
Tambo SDK: [https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo)

## Idea

Most applications require users to learn the interface first.
IntentDesk reverses that interaction model.

Users express intent naturally.
The UI adapts as the response.

Example: typing “add ₹200 groceries” dynamically brings up the relevant expense UI instead of navigating menus.
